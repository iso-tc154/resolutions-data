    Recognising that the ISO/TC 154 member bodies have approved two new work items on the BSR, it is resolved that TC 154 set up a specific Working Group, WG for BSR to realise the objective of the BSR which is:

    „To act as a central reference to assist in the universal, multilingual understanding of data across commerce, industry and administration.“

    Scope:

    - Developing, obtaining agreement and maintaining the Rules and Guidelines for defining entries in the BSR. (NP16668)
    - Developing and maintaining the Process/Methodology for the population of the BSR. (NP16668)
    - Stimulated the development of the sector specific and general data population, including the development of
    cross-sectorial relationships. (NP16669)
    - The development work for population per sector/industry shall be carried out by the sector/industry concerned, with the BSR Registration Authority acting as the central co-ordinating body to ensure common application of the rules and to liaise with organisations for resolution of problems on cross sector data.
    - Overseeing the development and implementation of the software for the register.
    - Overseeing the BSR operation and the Registration Authority function of the BSR content.

    Membership:

    - Nominated experts by those P members who indicated their support of the NWI’s and all other members who would now like to participate.
    - Representatives of those organisations responsible for sector/industry data specification such as:
    − ISO/TC 46 „Information and documentation“,
    − ISO/TC 68 „Banking, securities and other financial services“,
    − ISO/TC 184 „Industrial automation systems and integration“,
    − ISO/TC 184/SC 4 „Industrial data“,
    − ISO/TC 215 „Health informatics“ and
    − CEN/TC 251 „Medical informatics“,
    − UN/CEFACT especially „UN/EDIFACT“, and
    − Others, such as the signatures to the ISO/IEC/UN-ECE MoU.

    In particular organisations representing new technologies such as XML/EDI should be welcomed.
    - ISO/TC 154 would welcome a proposal from France to assume the convenorship of this working group.

    Initial Tasks:

    1. Develop a high level business plan and project deliverables.
    2. Develop a programme and timetable for the development, implementation and population of the BSR. The goal should be for implementation and initial population if possible by mid 1999.
    3. Process
      (a) Rules, Guidelines
      (b) Methodology
    according to the ISO procedures starting from the CD level.
    4. Communicate the BSR directions and plans in order to attract cross sector/industry support.
