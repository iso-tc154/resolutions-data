          ISO/TC 154 resolves together with the UNECE and UN/CEFACT liaisons
          to change TC154/JWG 4 to a WG as there is no joint publication
          foreseen at this time

          Note 1: This resolution was taken because there is no work at this
          time on a standard that was intended to be published jointly.
          Should a joint publication be approved between UN/CEFACT and TC154,
          it can be changed to a Joint Working Group.

          Note 2: This resolution should be explicitly read with the note
          that liaison experts are welcome and explicitly invited to
          participate in the future development of the technical report on
          the usage of ISO 6422 in the world.

          ISO/TC 154 resolves to request the ebMoU/MG to endorse TC154’s action
          - To note that the new ISO28000 series standards contradict and are misaligned with other established ISO and UN standards;
          - To note that this is a breach of one of the principal rules of ISO standards;
          - To note that ISO/TC 8 has not been responding to requests of the ebMoU/MG to clarify the situation;
          - Request ISO/TMB to act on this situation – to ensure that TC8 does not publish standards without due consultation with other TCs and acknowledged liaison organizations.
          - Request ISO/TMB to suspend the work on the ISO 28000 series and consider the withdrawal of its published standards should TC 8 continue to work on this topic without the due consultation of other groups
