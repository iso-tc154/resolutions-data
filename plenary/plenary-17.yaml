        message: |
          BACKGROUND:
            - Historically the UNTDED was first issued as the single, common repository of semantic concepts that are used in the paper environment, later also in EDI, with bridges (so called "topographical co-ordinates") to sectoral directories as CIMP of IATA, SAD of EC/EFTA, SWIFT and MAR of IMO ;
            - the EDI developments, specially UN/EDIFACT, were based initially on this semantic concepts repository ISO7372 (UNTDED) ;
            - over time, the concept of generic data element and coded qualifiers developed by UN/EDIFACT enforced the syntax dependence for expressing semantic concepts ;
            - hence a semantic concept in UN/EDIFACT requires usually a combination of at least a data element along with a code value.
