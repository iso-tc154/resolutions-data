      ISO/TC 154 resolves to discontinue, at least for the time being, any development of new BSUs for the BSR. ISO/TC 154 recognises that there are empowered bodies within UN/CEFACT that are better resourced to do this work, and that any duplication of effort would be a waste of their limited resources.
      This resolution will be reassessed at the next (19th) plenary meeting.
