        message: ISO/TC 154 regards the harmonisation and registration of data as one of its major roles and recognises that the BSR is a key tool to achieve that objective. Further, in accordance with the ISO BSR/CC resolution 96/8 stating that the BSR Rules and Guidelines and Content shall become ISO standards with its own registration authority, ISO/TC 154 would like to be given the responsability for processing the BSR Project during the project phase and will require the setting up of a subcommittee and establishing a maintenance agency for ongoing BSR operation and maintenance once the project phase has been completed

        Recognising that the ISO 7372 (TDED) covers data elements in support of trade and that these data elements are composed of data elements concepts plus representation and that the BSR is predicated on the specification of data elements concepts alone, ISO/TC 154 resolved that
        - there is a need for a consolidated data element directory to cover BSU representation in standards published by ISO/TC 154, mainly ISO 6422 (Layout key for trade documents) and UN/TDID
        - in order to achieve consistency of data specification across all subject areas, the work of ISO/TC 154 shall be progressed in close collaboration with ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 14 (and the use of ISO/IEC 11179) and the BSR project
        - the data element directory shall have its own maintenance procedures and rules
        - at a further stage other subject areas can be added
