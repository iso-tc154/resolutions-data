        ISO/TC 154 resolves that a recommendation should be developed by the TC154 secretariat for the ISO/TMB proposing the setting up of a single ISO technical committee covering the meta standards and the implementation level standards in support of EDI/EC. This would group the existing ISO/TC154 with ex JTC1/SC14 and SC30. It would have the impact of streamlining the standardization process, including positive cost and resource impacts, as well as providing a single focal point for ISO on EDI/EC matters in the ISO/IEC/UN-ECE MoU.
