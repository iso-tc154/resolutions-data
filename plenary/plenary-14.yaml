      ISO/TC 154 resolves that an ad hoc group be established to prepare a procedure for the maintenance and distribution of service elements (segments, composite data elements, data elements and codes). This ad hoc group should complete its work by the end of June 1998 so that the procedure will be in place with the publication of the new version 4 of ISO 9735 in autumn 1998.

      The currently identified members of the ad hoc group are: Jean Kubler, Jean-Francois Legendre, Henry Schlieper, Francois Vuilleumier. Other P-members will be requested to nominate experts to Mr. Legendre, convenor - e-mail: legendre@compuserve.com. The work will be handled electronically and not via meetings.

      ISO/TC 154 resolves that a recommendation should be developed by the
      TC 154 secretariat for the ISO/TMB proposing the setting up of a
      single ISO technical committee covering the meta standards and the
      implementation level standards in support of EDI/EC. This would group
      the existing ISO/TC 154 with ex JTC1/SC14 and SC30. It would have the
      impact of streamlining the standardization process, including positive
      cost and resource impacts, as well as providing a single focal point
      for ISO on EDI/EC matters in the ISO/IEC/UN-ECE MoU.
