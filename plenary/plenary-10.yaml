        The current scope of ISO/TC is:
        "Standardization of documents and representation of data used for information interchange within administration, commerce and industry. Excluded are documents intended to be read by machines only, fallin into the responsibility of ISO/IEC JTC 1."
        
        # TC 154 wants to give the following interpretation of its present scope:
        
        # Bodies other than ISO/IEC JTC 1 are responsible for standards in the area of machine readable data and shall be added to the exclusion.
        
        # Also excluded from the scope are:
        
        # 1 Development of methodology and registration procedures
        # 2 Industrial data (related to manufacturing or production industrial activities)
        
        # Within the scope is work based on the following and which, where relevant, will be developed into international standards following, when available, existing standardized methodologies:
        
        # 1 Provide and/or offer coordination for application oriented data.
        # 2 Specify requirements to improve the use of EDI in business processes in administration, commerce and industry. Based on these requirements, register and where appropriate develop into International Standard EDI scenarios and data structures (e.g. messages, segments and data from UN/EDIFACT TDID) for administration, commerce and industry.
        # 3 For application oriented EDI scenarios and data structures, developed outside of administration, commerce and industry by other ISO/TCs or external bodies, provide coherency (e.g. between the use of data on paper and in EDI) and assist in resolving issues between technical and business data
        # 4 Maintain existing ISO/TC 154 standards such as the EDIFACT syntax (ISO 9735) AND TDED (ISO 7372) in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between IEC, ISO and UN/ECE concerning standardization in the field of EDI and Open-edi.

        # Annex A.2 reads
        # "Recognizing that the standardization of syntaxes for edi is broader than EDIFACT, it is recognized that ISO and IEC are the more appropiate organizations for the development and maintenance of standardized syntaxes for electronic data interchange. However, in the case of the EDIFACT application level syntax (ISO 9735), including its interactive version and associated security, it is understood that its development and maintenance is a collaborative ISO-UN/ECE activity, to be carried out in a joint group, the secretariat of which is to be provided by ISO and the chair to be provided by UN/ECE WP.4. The results of the work of the joint group will be submitted for parallel approval in both ISO and UN/ECE and will be published jointly by ISO and UN/ECE."
