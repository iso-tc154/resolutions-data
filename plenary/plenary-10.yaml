    message: |
      The current scope of ISO/TC is:
      _"Standardization of documents and representation of data used for
      information interchange within administration, commerce and
      industry_.

      _Excluded are documents intended to be read by machines
      only, falling into the responsibility of ISO/IEC JTC 1."_

      TC 154 wants to give the following interpretation of its present
      scope:

      Bodies other than ISO/IEC JTC 1 are responsible for standards in
      the area of machine readable data and shall be added to the
      exclusion.

      Also excluded from the scope are:

      1. Development of methodology and registration procedures

      2. Industrial data (related to manufacturing or production
      industrial activities)

      Within the scope is work based on the following and which, where
      relevant, will be developed into international standards following,
      when available, existing standardized methodologies:

      1. Provide and/or offer coordination for application oriented data.

      2. Specify requirements to improve the use of EDI in business
      processes in administration, commerce and industry. Based on these
      requirements, register and where appropriate develop into
      International Standard EDI scenarios and data structures (e.g.
      messages, segments and data from UN/EDIFACT TDID) for
      administration, commerce and industry.

      3. For application oriented EDI scenarios and data structures,
      developed outside of administration, commerce and industry by other
      ISO/TCs or external bodies, provide coherency (e.g. between the use
      of data on paper and in EDI) and assist in resolving issues between
      technical and business data

      4. Maintain existing ISO/TC 154 standards such as the EDIFACT
      syntax (ISO 9735) AND TDED (ISO 7372) in accordance with the
      Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between IEC, ISO and UN/ECE
      concerning standardization in the field of EDI and Open-edi.
