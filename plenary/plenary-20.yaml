        message: ISO/TC154 are very grateful to Andrew Schoka for providing the group with an introduction to the past, present and future work plans of TC204. Andrew described TC204’s new Work Item, NP24533, entitled "Data Dictionary and Message Set to Facilitate the Movement of Freight and its Intermodal Transfer - Road Transport Information Interchanges". He reported that liaisons have been established with key organisations e.g. UN/CEFACT. At a recent meeting of ISO TC204 WG7.2 it was recognised that collaboration was an important element of this project. It appears that there are areas of potential overlap that need urgent investigation, creating opportunities for harmonisation. Particular areas include (a) methodology - UN/CEFACT-ebXML CCTS, (b) data element naming and defining - the ISO 7372 (UNTDED) MA and the several UN/CEFACT TBG domain BP modelling and CC definition projects. These include work in the supply chain related domain groups TBG1 (Materials Management), TBG2 (Procurement), TBG3 (Transport & Logistics), TBG4 (Customs), & TBG5 (Finance).

        message: TC154 recognises that there exists a tangible opportunity for crucial convergence between the TC204 ISO 14817 and the UN/CEFACT-ebXML CCTS. In order to promote and secure this much needed convergence, TC154 resolves to support and strengthen liaison between the 7372MA activity, the UN/CEFACT Forum, and TC204 to achieve this goal.

          ISO/TC154 requests the ISO8601 Expert (Editing) Group to consolidate all comments received to date into a table, updating document 8601RevN007.

          The Group will make an initial ranking into categories of:

          1. 'will implement' on e.g. typographical errors, obvious improvements,

          2. 'will not implement' on comments that are counter-productive,

          3. 'for wider discussion' when opinions from all TC154 participants are valuable, updating document 8601RevN002r1.

          These two papers will be distributed by the Expert (Editing) Group to TC154 membership, seeking confirmation of categories 1 and 2, and further input on category 3.

          Distribution is anticipated by end May, and feedback would be required by end July. It is anticipated that a revised ISO 8601 could be distributed for the CD ballot in August.

          Dear Mike:

          This will confirm that UN/CEFACT and OASIS wish to have the pending TC154 ballot withdrawn. We believe it was launched in error, as our internal reviews were not completed. It is important to our constituents to adhere to our processes.

          This withdrawal is without prejudice to our ongoing consultations regarding the options for further promoting ebXML standards, which include working with ISO. Both of our organizations value our cooperative relationship with ISO.

          We also wish to thank you personally for taking the time to clarify the applicable rules and options. Your January 22nd explanation and our January 30th conference call were very helpful, and your insights will assist in our deliberations.

          If there is any further action needed by ISOCS to confirm the wishes of the specification owners, please advise us.

          Best regards - Jamie Clark - Chair, ebXML Joint Coordinating Committee

          Subject: Eb-XML specifications under ISO approval in ISO TC154-JTC1 participation

          Dear Doug and Bruce,

          OASIS and UN/CEFACT are now submitting their eb-XML specifications for approval as ISO TS (Technical specifications) in ISO TC154. 6 out of the 8 eb-XML parts will be submitted as a first package, the 2 others (part 2 and 8) will come later, when completed.

          Given that 2/3 of the eb-XML specs are of direct relevance to TC154 (within TC154 scope), it has been agreed that the eb-XML specs would be hosted by TC154 with the creation of a new (virtual) joint WG (under TC154 lead) involving the JTC1 SCs concerned ( mainly SC32) in order to involve the JTC1 expertise in the process.

          The ballot on the 6 first Technical specifications will be launched by ISO TC154 in the next few days, under the generic title ISO TS 15000: "Electronic Business eXtensible Mark-up Language (ebXML) parts 1,3,4,5,6 and 7", and we would ask JTC1 SC32 to comment on the various parts (specifications) when they are of direct relevance to your subcommittee and to nominate expert(s) if needed, to discuss the potential comments with the parties involved.

          François Vuilleumier as TC154 Chair and secretary will contact you ASAP to set up the process.

          [...]

          Should you need any further information, do not hesitate to contact me or François directly or Keith Brannon at ISOCS. Keith will contact Lisa for securing the JTC1 participation

          Kind regards and Happy New Year - Sophie
