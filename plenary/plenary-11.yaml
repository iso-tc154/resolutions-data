      The ad hoc group was asked to continue their discussion on the subject by considering how the maintenance process for the UN/TDID and UN/TDED could be synchronised so that the single standard could be effectively managed, and present a proposal before the end of August 1996 for discussion at the next plenary meeting.

      Attached is a copy of the edited recommendation.

      The ad hoc group shall also investigate the link between the electronic messages especially UN/EDIFACT and the respective paper documents.

      TC 154 also resolves that, because of lack of information, it is too early to take any decision on the take over of BSR results or any specific aspect of it, until further investigation is performed.

      In that respect TC 154 is expecting to get as soon as possible the documents to be issued by the BSR/MC (see BSR N102 Resolution 96/8) and the ISO/BSR Coordinating Committee documents. These documents will be submitted along with the Australian contribution on BSR (Doc. N 188). Comments are to be received by 1996-06-28, and allocated to a sub group created by resolution 92. Comments are especially expected on:

      - is TC 154 to take any role in BSR standardization activities?
      - in case of yes, which aspects of the BSR project may (or need to) be standardized by TC 154?
