          ISO/TC 154 requests its secretariat to distribute the French member
          body contribution to the meeting of ISO/TC 154 (Doc. N 187) to all

        date_effective: 1996-03-15
          An ad hoc group will be established to review the comments received
          and, if necessary, identify any changes to the present scope.

          Members of the ad hoc group are:

          Tuisko Buchmann
          Marcel Deturche
          Ingeborg Burger-Balogh

          The results of the ad hoc group are expected to be submitted to the

          The results should provide the basis for the strategic policy
          statement of TC 154 which will be discussed at the next plenary
          meeting.

        message: The ad hoc group was asked to continue their discussion on the subject by considering how the maintenance process for the UN/TDID and UN/TDED could be synchronised so that the single standard could be effectively managed, and present a proposal before the end of August 1996 for discussion at the next plenary meeting.

        Attached is a copy of the edited recommendation.

        The ad hoc group shall also investigate the link between the electronic messages especially UN/EDIFACT and the respective paper documents.

        message: |
        TC 154 also resolves that, because of lack of information, it is too early to take any decision on the take over of BSR results or any specific aspect of it, until further investigation is performed.
        In that respect TC 154 is expecting to get as soon as possible the documents to be issued by the BSR/MC (see BSR N102 Resolution 96/8) and the ISO/BSR Coordinating Committee documents. These documents will be submitted along with the Australian contribution on BSR (Doc. N 188). Comments are to be received by 1996-06-28, and allocated to a sub group created by resolution 92. Comments are especially expected on:
        - is TC 154 to take any role in BSR standardization activities?
        - in case of yes, which aspects of the BSR project may (or need to) be standardized by TC 154?
