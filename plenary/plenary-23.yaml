      Several ebXML parts have been updated since being approved as ISO/TS 15000 Technical Specifications. However, no requests have been received to formally update these ISO specifications. It is critically important that all members who have maintenance responsibility of ISO/TC 154 standards fulfil their responsibilities.

      Therefore, ISO/TC 154 resolves to remind OASIS that as the Maintenance Agency for ISO/TS 15000 parts 1 through 4, they must initiate action to update these ISO/TSs consistent with updated versions published as OASIS specifications, or else ISO/TC 154 will take action to request removal of the appropriate ISO version.
